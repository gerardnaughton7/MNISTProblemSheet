MNIST Problem Sheet for emerging technology

# Objectives:
1. Read the image files

Download the image and label files, have Python decompress them and read them byte by byte into appropriate data structures in memory.

2. Output an image to the console

Output the third image in the training set to the console. Do this by representing any pixel value less than 128 as a full stop and any other pixel value as a hash symbol.

3. Output the image files as PNGs

Use Python to output the image files as PNGs, saving them in a subfolder in your repository.

# How to use this repository?

Firstly download anaconda in order to code in python.
You can download anaconda through this link and following their instructions:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

To view the code you can use any code editor from as basic textpad to pycharm. I am using Visual studio code.
Here is a link to download Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

With anaconda you recieve a terminal called anaconda prompt through this you will be able to run your python code by simply using the command "python" followed by your file name.py.

You will also have to download the images for this program. 
Here is the link to the images: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
After you have downloaded the zipped images place them into a folder called data within your repository.

You should now be able to run this code.
